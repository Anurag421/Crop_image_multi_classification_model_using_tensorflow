# Goal - To Build Agricultural Crops Multi Classification model using Tensorflow.

# Achieved  Matrices - loss: 0.0514 - accuracy: 0.9913 - val_loss: 0.2030 - val_accuracy: 0.9688

## Image Data Handling - Using userdefined functions - Removed currpted images 
## Data Preprocessing - Used Keras Utils function for creating data pipeline and images scaling 
## For Images size Scaling - to make scale 0-1 used lamda function
## Added Required sequential Layers
## Used Relu with Softmax classifier
## Compiled and trained the model
